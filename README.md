For this project, the user may have to manually navigate to Level One. It's located in the folder titled "Scenes".

Here are my answers to the questions from the instructions:

Question 3: 

Level One: For Level One, I want to get the player acclimated to the general controls of the game. This involves walking around, looking around, and jumping. So, to reach the end of this level the user will have to jump on some platforms, without explicit instructions on how to use the portal gun yet.

Level Two: This level will introduce the raycast portal gun to the player. So, to reach the end of the level, the user will have to use the portal gun in a very simple way.

Level Three: Level three will test the user once again with higher difficulty. So, to reach the end of the level, the user will have to use the portal gun multiple times and make some jumps.

Level Four: This level will introduce the usage of the projectile portals. It will be similar difficulty to level three, with a different map layout.

Level Five: Level Five will be the toughest layer in the game, and will allow the user to choose their own path. They will have all portal guns at their disposal and will have to navigate the puzzle to the end.

Level Six: This will be a simple ending level, alerting the player to the fact that they beat the game.

Question 5:

a. For this homework assignment, I had my roomate test my game. In general, the feedback I received was very positive. They liked the core mechanics of the game and thought it was interesting. In terms of constructive criticism, he said that I should change up some of the color scheme (so everything isn't blue). Also, he said that some moving obstacles could add another level of difficulty to the game, which would be fun.

b. If I were developing this game further, to address the constructive criticism, I would first add some textures and different colors to my map. This would create distinct areas and make it easier to follow. Also, I would probably add some arrows throughout the map, which would direct the users on where to go. Also, I would add more obstacles for the user to avoid. This could include falling spikes, spinning barriers, and arrows that move across the map. I think this would make the game a lot more interesting in general.
